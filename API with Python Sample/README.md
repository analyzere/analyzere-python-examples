# API Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook provides an easy entry point to working with our API through Python. You can clone the repository and run the notebook locally or you can use MyBinder. The notebook includes information on how to:

- Create and work with loss sets
- Create and work with layers
- Create portfolios based on layers
- Calculate various metrics
- ... and much more!

## Running the Jupyter Notebook Locally
In order to run the notebook locally, you must have:

- Python installed
- Pip installed
- pyenv / conda (or any other virtual environment) installed
- Jupyter installed

Given the above requirements:

1. Download the notebook from the repository (or clone the repository)
2. Create a virtual environment in the "API Python Sample" directory
3. Activate the environment
4. Run jupyter notebook in your terminal

## Running the Jupyter Notebook with MyBinder
MyBinder will allow you to run the notebook without the need to do anything locally.

1. Navigate to MyBinder
2. Insert https://github.com/analyzere/analyzere-python-examples into the "Github Repository name or URL" field
3. Click "Launch"

This will automatically create a container with the notebook and open a tab once the container has been built.
